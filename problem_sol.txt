Problems & Solution while creating the Daily Tasks App


Problem 1. ==> VirtualizedLists should never be nested inside plain ScrollViews 
with the same orientation because it can break windowing and other functionality - use
another VirtualizedList-backed container instead.

Solution ==> Ok! So the FlatList is default scrollable when the parent is set flex:1

--------------------------------&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&-----------------------------------

Problem 2. ==> Style the nested element when it's renderd
Solution ==> with - contentContainerStyle={{ display: "flex", gap: 20 }}.


--------------------------------&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&-----------------------------------

Problem 3. ==> get future date
Solution ==> const dt = new Date()
             dt.setDate(dt.getDate() + parseInt(days))


--------------------------------&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&-----------------------------------

Problem 4. ==> creating a file in phone storage to store files to access if the app
            is uninstall
Solution ==> for this we need react-native-fs (it's help to create a folder that will
          not delete even after we uninstall the app) but it's not work with expo app
          and the AsyncStorage is static with app when we delete the app data will 
          also loose


Problem 5. ==> want to use native react app without expo.
Solution ==> npx expo prebuild --clean (it will change the expo code to native code)


Problem 6. ==> new added content is not visible when navigate back
Solution ==>  > Your useEffect runs only on mount (and when router changes).
              > Navigating back doesn’t trigger a re-mount.
              > Therefore, new data isn’t fetched.
              > Solution: Use useFocusEffect or useIsFocused instead of useEffect


Problem 7. ==> after updating yarn 1.22.xx to yarn 4.9.0 i got error about expo cli not working and other errors
Solution ==> added a .yarnrc.yml yarn configuration file and add nodeLinger : node-moudles 


Problem 8. ==> localStorage key type error
Solution ==>  [AsyncStorage] Using number type for key is not supported. This can lead to unexpected behavior/errors. 
              Use string instead.
